        <p>Optimality Theory is a linguistic theory developed by Alan Prince and
        Paul Smolensky (Prince and Smolensky 1993). Partial Order Optimality
        Theory is a conservative generalization of the classical theory that
        allows one to describe and explain variation. This web application
        provides tools for working with both theories.</p>

          <p>What separates this from other OT software?</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Number of optimal candidates</h3>
          <p>
            In classical OT, only one <a href="#def-candidate">candidate</a> can be optimal. In Partial
            Order OT, multiple candidates can be optimal. This is useful for
            modelling variation. For example: for a given input, multiple outputs may appear
            in the same dialect (e.g. multiple pronunciations of "data").
          </p>
        <h3>Finding all grammars</h3>
          <p>
            Most learning algorithms can find a single <a href="#def-grammar">grammar</a> that is compatible with the data. OTOrder finds all the grammars compatible with the
            data. This is made possible by the algorithm described in Djalali 2013.
          </p>
        <h3>Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            Along with finding all the grammars compatible with the data,
            OTOrder lists them in terms of their complexity, beginning with the
            simplest, as per Occam's Razor. Complexity is measured in two ways:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong><a href="#def-grammar-size">Grammar size.</a></strong> Since a grammar is an ordering of the constraints, it can be expressed as a set of ordered pairs.
              One pair <i>(C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>)</i> means that <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> dominates <i>C<sub>2</sub></i>. Grammar size refers to the number of such ordered
              pairs, or rankings, present in the given grammar. Larger grammars are more complicated than smaller grammars, as they are more restrictive and contain more
              information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><a href="#def-ranking-volume">Ranking volume.</a></strong> Each grammar is a partial order of the set of constraints, and every partial order is compatible
              with a certain number of total orders. This number is the ranking volume of that grammar. For example, given the constraints <i>C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub></i>, and
              <i>C<sub>3</sub></i> and the partial order {<i>C<sub>1</sub></i> &raquo; <i>C<sub>3</sub></i>, <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> &raquo; <i>C<sub>3</sub></i>}, there are two total
              orders that are compatible. They are <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> &raquo; <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> &raquo; <i>C<sub>3</sub></i> and <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> &raquo;
              <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> &raquo; <i>C<sub>3</sub></i>. The original grammar has a ranking volume of size two.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>A note on statistics</h4>
          <p>
            Just as the ranking volume can be calculated for a whole grammar, a
            ranking volume can be calculated for each candidate. Given a grammar
            and its set of compatible total orders, a certain number of those
            total orders select for each candidate.
          </p>
          <p>
            This subset of the subset of total orders is the ranking volume for
            each candidate, and the distribution of percentages across the
            candidates gives an empirically falsifiable prediction of
            variation.
          </p>
        <h3>Entailments</h3>
          <p>
            OTOrder also finds entailments between input-output pairs (candidates), i.e. implicational universals. We refer to these as <a href="#def-global-entailments">global
            entailments</a>. These are useful for exploring linguistic typologies. If a certain <a href="#def-candidate">candidate</a> wins, i.e. is present in a language, what
            other candidates are guaranteed to also be present in the language?
          </p>
        <h3>Visualizing graphs</h3>
          <p>
            OTOrder visualizes graphs for every grammar calculated, as well as the
            graph of entailments. These graphs are displayed in PNG format
            and users are encouraged to download them for use in publications.

        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>How to use this website</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Calculator</h3>
          Begin by going to <a href="{{ url_for('tools.calculator') }}">the calculator page</a> and entering a <a href="#def-dataset">dataset</a>. If you would prefer to use a
          pre-entered dataset, create an account (for two free datasets) or check out the <a href="{{ url_for('tools.example_edit') }}">Kiparsky example dataset</a>. Enter inputs,
          outputs, constraints, and the number of violations each candidate has on each constraint. Any of the violation boxes that are left empty default to 0. You can also
          choose a title for your dataset by typing in the "Dataset Title" box. If you do not specify a title, a random string will be chosen for the title of your dataset. Once
          you have finished editing, choose "All grammars" or "Classical grammars", depending on whether you want only the totally-ordered <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a> (as
          in classical OT) or all the grammars, partially- and totally-ordered. Once you click to choose, you will be redirected to the grammars page.
        <h3>Grammars</h3>
          The grammars page may take a few minutes to load, as it calculates the compatible <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a> for your <a href="#def-dataset">dataset</a>. Once it
          has finished loading, you will see several things:
          <h4>Global statistics</h4>
            A chart with global statistics, that displays the numbers of partial and classical grammars that are compatible with your dataset, along with the total number of
            possible grammars of each type and the percentage of possible grammars that are compatible with your data.
            <p></p><p>
            Beneath this chart is a set of links to entailments and to edit the dataset.
            </p>
          <h4>Grammar navigation</h4>
            At the bottom of the page the compatible <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a> will be displayed, along with some controls to navigate the set of grammars. There is a selector box to choose
            the measure of complexity by which the grammars are sorted. The options are <a href="#def-ranking-volume">ranking volume</a> and <a href="#def-grammar-size">grammar
            size</a>, and the default is ranking volume. In either case, the simplest (smallest size or largest ranking volume) grammars are displayed initially. Changing the
            sorting key causes the grammars to be recalculated and re-sorted. Below the selection box is a row of numbered buttons, with the rightmost button depressed. The
            numbers depend on the sorting key. If the grammars are sorted by size, clicking on a number will display the grammars of that size. If they are sorted by ranking
            volume, clicking on a number will display all the grammars with that ranking volume. If there are too many grammars to display on one page, the "Prev" and "Next"
            buttons can be used to navigate further.
          <h4>Grammars</h4>
          Finally, the <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a> themselves will be displayed at the bottom of the page. For each grammar, the set notation will be displayed on top.
          Every ordered pair <i>(C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>)</i> in the set denotes that <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> outranks <i>C<sub>2</sub></i>. On the left is a graphic
          visualization of the grammar, where each node is a constraint, and an arrow from <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>C<sub>2</sub></i> denotes that <i>C<sub>1</sub></i> outranks
          <i>C<sub>2</sub></i>. On the right is a table with statistics for that grammar. For each output in an <a href="#def-input-group">input group</a>, the number and
          percentage of that grammar's compatible total orders that cause it to win are displayed. In other words, each <a href="#def-candidate">candidate</a>'s ranking volume is
          displayed. The distribution of percentages gives an empirically falsifiable prediction of variation for that grammar.
          <p></p><p>Click on the "Entailments" link under the global statistics, which will redirect you to another page.</p>
        <h3>Entailments</h3>
          The <a href="#def-global-entailments">entailments</a> page may take a few minutes to load, and once it has loaded it displays a few navigation links and a graph
          of all the entailments for your dataset. In the graph, each node represents an <a href="#def-candidate">input-output pair (candidate)</a>. If multiple candidates
          are listed in one node, they are part of an entailment cycle in which each candidate entails each other candidate in the cycle. They are therefore functionally
          equivalent, and can be listed in a single node. An arrow from node <i>N<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>N<sub>2</sub></i> indicates that all the candidates listed in
          <i>N<sub>1</sub></i> entail the candidates in <i>N<sub>2</sub></i>. Entailments are transitive, so everything entailed by the candidates in <i>N<sub>2</sub></i> is also
          entailed by <i>N<sub>2</sub></i>. Click on the "Edit dataset" link.
        <h3>Saving</h3>
          If you are not logged in, attempting to edit your <a href="#def-dataset">dataset</a> will redirect you to a login page. Log in, if you would like to save the work on
          your dataset and be able to edit and come back to it in the future. If you do not have an account, click on the "Create one" link at the bottom of the page. Logging in
          will automatically save the dataset to your account. After logging in, you will be able to edit your dataset as often as you would like, experimenting with how changes
          affect changes to the compatible <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a> and <a href="#def-global-entailments">entailments</a>.
        <h3>Account</h3>
          To view the list of your <a href="#def-dataset">datasets</a>, log in and click on your username in the upper right hand corner. From the dropdown menu, click on "View
          account". This redirect you to your account page, where you can see all of your datasets. For each dataset, there are links to the <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a>
          and <a href="#def-global-entailments">entailments</a>, and buttons to edit, copy, or delete the dataset. Copying the dataset creates an exact copy which you can edit,
          if you would like to have multiple variations of the same dataset without re-entering from scratch.
        <p></p>
        <p>Good luck and enjoy!</p>

          <p class="in-depth">
            <h3>In Depth</h3>
            In Optimality Theory, a grammar is simply a strict ranking of constraints. Under classical Optimality Theory, this ranking has to be a total order. This means that each
            constraint has to be ranked relative to every other constraint. There can be no ties, so the graph of a total ranking looks like a straight line. However, under Partial
            Order Optimality Theory, the constraints can be ranked in any strict partial order. Formally, this means that not every constraint needs to be ranked with respect to
            every other constraint. In other words, there can be ties, so a graph might have branches or constraints floating by themselves, if they are not ranked with respect to
            any other constraint.

            Each <a href="#def-grammar">grammar</a> is a ranking, and a ranking can be represented as a set of ordered pairs, where each pair (A, B) says A is ranked over B. These sets are closed under
            transitivity, which just means that if (A, B) and (B, C) are in the set, then (A, C) has to be in the set as well. The grammar size refers to the number of ordered

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            Notice a couple of things from this table. In general, when the number of rankings in the partial ranking increases, the ranking volume decreases. One extreme is the
            empty partial ranking, which is compatible with all possible total rankings (in this case, 6). The other extreme is when the partial ranking is also a total ranking.
            In this case, there is only one compatible total ranking (the partial ranking itself), so it has a ranking volume of 1.

            <h3>In Depth</h3>
            Given an input, an output, and a constraint, it is straightforward to determine the number of times the output violates the constraint, for the input. In classical OT
            tableaux this is the number of asterisks in the cell for the <a href="#def-candidate">candidate</a> and the constraint. If, rather than a single constraint, we have a
            list of them, the violation vector is a list of the number of violations (in the same order as the list of constraints).

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            One <a href="#def-candidate">candidate</a> is said to globally entail another if every <a href="#def-grammar">grammar</a> that makes the first candidate optimal also
            makes the second candidate optimal.

            <h3>In Depth</h3>
            For every <a href="#def-candidate">candidate</a>, there are a certain number of <a href="#def-grammar">grammars</a> that will make it optimal for its input. If every
            single one of those grammars also makes a second candidate optimal for its input, then the first grammar entails the second candidate. Under classical OT, only one
            candidate per input can be optimal, so candidates can only entail candidates with different inputs. However, under Partial Order OT, candidates with the same input
            can potentially entail or be entailed by each other. We take all of the entailments for a <a href="#def-dataset">dataset</a> and visualize them as a graph.
