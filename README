This app is an Optimality Theory (OT) constraint-ranking website. Implemented
using Flask, it is built on a Python implementation of Alex Djalali's solution
to the ranking problem in theoretical OT. For the details of his solution, see
his paper "A constructive solution to the ranking problem in Partial Order
Optimality Theory" (2013) which can be found at
stanford.edu/~djalali/publications.html. For the source of his implementation,
refer to github.com/alexdjalali/OT.

The app is organized loosely according to the recommendations in the Flask
documentation (flask.pocoo.org/docs/). The views are implemented using Flask
Blueprints for modularity.

In order to run it, make sure you have pip installed. Then clone the
repository, run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt', then
'python runserver.py' to start the basic server on your local machine.
